## 🎯 Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Features
1. ✅ Add Terms Functionality
    1. ✅ Implement a user interface for adding terms and their definitions.
    2. ✅ Support basic validation for input fields.
2. ✅ Study Terms in Basic Mode
    1. ✅ Create a simple study mode where terms are shown in a circular sequence.
    2. ✅ Include basic navigation (next/previous buttons) for moving between terms.
3. ✅ Local Storage (IndexedDB) Integration
    1. ✅ Implement functionality to save and retrieve terms from local storage.
    2. ✅ Use this feature for demonstration purposes without requiring a backend.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Study Features
1. Spaced Repetition Mode
     1. Design and implement an advanced study mode based on the spaced repetition technique.
     2. Include an algorithm for scheduling term reviews based on user performance.
2. Image Support for Cards
    1. Allow users to upload or link images to terms for enhanced memorization.
    2. Display images alongside the terms during study sessions.

### Phase 3: AI-Powered Enhancements
1. AI-Generated Associative Examples
     1. Use AI to generate example sentences using the terms being studied.
     2. Provide users with associative contexts to reinforce learning.

### Phase 4: Multi-Language Support
1. Add a Second Language
    1. Enable users to add translations or definitions in a second language.
    2. Allow switching between languages during study sessions.

### Future Plans (Optional Enhancements)
1. Sync data across devices using cloud storage.
2. Support audio pronunciation for terms and sentences.
3. Gamify the learning process with achievements or streaks.
